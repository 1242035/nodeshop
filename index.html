          <h1>NodeShop</h1>

<p>This is my take on a Node.js powered E-Commerce system. The main framework used is Express, with Jade handling the view engine and Passport handling user authentication.</p>

<p>The project is still very much work in progress, and any help would be much appreciated as I am still learning Node.js</p>

<p>Here are some known areas with issues that need addressing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkout incomplete</li>
<li>Login system works but needs improving (Validation etc.)</li>
<li>Product image storage and retrieval system needed</li>
<li>Product page is incomplete</li>
<li>Search does not work</li>
<li>No method of payment yet</li>
</ul><h1>Update 23 May '13</h1>

<p>Quite a few areas of the system have been tidied up and improved, most notably the shopping cart, the basics of a checkout, the category system and the login system. </p>

<p>The checkout is moving towards something that may be usable quite soon so watch this space! </p>

<p>Also planned is an admin area, which I am considering running as a seperate server. This would make it secure and easy to access from a development envrironment.</p>
