{"name":"NodeShop","tagline":"Node.JS E-Commerce System","body":"# NodeShop\r\n\r\n[Shop Front Demo](shop.nodeshop.org)\r\n\r\n[Admin Area Demo](admin.nodeshop.org)\r\n\r\nThis is my take on a Node.js powered E-Commerce system. The main framework used is Express, with Jade handling the view engine and Passport handling user authentication.\r\n\r\nThe project is still very much work in progress, and any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere are some known areas with issues that need addressing:\r\n\r\n  * Checkout incomplete\r\n  * Product image storage and retrieval system needed\r\n  * Product page is incomplete\r\n  * Search does not work\r\n  * No method of payment yet\r\n  \r\n\r\n#Update 21 August '13\r\n\r\nSorry it's been a while but I've been busy recently looking for a new job. \r\n\r\nI'm creating a google group for anyone who would like to get involved with he project, this will be a place to discuss features, bugs, suggestions and anything else about the project.\r\n\r\nHere's whatâ€™s new in 0.0.6:\r\n\r\n  * Auto Login after registered\r\n  * Added more to the order page\r\n  * Basics of an admin area\r\n  * Started product page in admin area\r\n  * Few other bits that I've forgot\r\n\r\n#Update 28 June '13\r\n\r\nTidied up some more code, updated the file structure. Added a guest checkout with form validation. Coming soon will be the order form with some kind of payment system, probably paypal.\r\n\r\nStarted working on an admin area which is slowly coming along, will probably be in the next release.\r\n\r\n#Update 23 May '13\r\n\r\nQuite a few areas of the system have been tidied up and improved, most notably the shopping cart, the basics of a checkout, the category system and the login system. \r\n\r\nThe checkout is moving towards something that may be usable quite soon so watch this space! \r\n\r\nAlso planned is an admin area, which I am considering running as a separate server. This would make it secure and easy to access from a development environment.\r\n\r\nBilly Topley","google":"UA-40557205-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
