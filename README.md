# NodeShop

This is my take on a Node.js powered E-Commerce system. The main framework used is Express, with Jade handling the view engine and Passport handling user authentication.

The project is still very much work in progress, and any help would be much appreciated as I am still learning Node.js

Here are some known areas with issues that need addressing:

  * Shoppping Cart incomplete but now working!
  * Login system works but needs incomplete
  * Product image storage and retrieval system needed
  * Product page is incomplete
  * Search does not work
  * No Payment Gateway

#Update 21 May '13

Quite a few areas of the system have been tidied up and improved, most notably the shopping cart, the category system and the login system. 

The shopping cart is moving towards something that may actually be usable quite soon so watch this space! 

Also planned is an admin area, which is ran as a contained seperate server. This makes it very secure and also easy to access from a development evrironment.
